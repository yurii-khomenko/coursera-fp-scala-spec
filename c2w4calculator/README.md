In this assignment, you will use Function Reactive Programming (FRP), with the Signal[A] class that you have seen in the lectures, to implement a spreadsheet-like calculator. In this calculator, cells can depend on the value of other cells, and are recomputed automatically when the latter change.

The User Interface (UI) for the programs in this assignment are Web-based, i.e., they run in an HTML page in your Web browser. To compile your code to runnable JavaScript, we use [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/), the Scala to JavaScript compiler. We have all set it up for you in the assignment template, but this will change the way you run the program.

### Tweet length monitoring

As you probably know, Tweets (messages on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)) are limited to 140 characters. When typing a Tweet, it is very helpful to receive instantaneous visual feedback on the number of characters you have left.

The traditional way of implementing this visual feedback is to set up an onchange event handler (a callback) on the text area. In the event handler, we imperatively ask for the text, compute the length, then write back the computed remaining characters.

In FRP, we use Signals to abstract away the mutable nature of the UI (both inputs and outputs) while working on the logic that binds output to input, which is functional.

#### From Tweet text to remaining char count

Your first task is to implement the function tweetRemainingCharsCount in TweetLength.scala. This function takes a Signal[String] of the text of a Tweet being typed, and returns a Signal[Int] with the corresponding number of characters that are left.

Note that the Tweet length is _not_ text.length, as this would not properly handle [supplementary characters](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/supplementary-142654.html). Use the provided function tweetLength to correctly compute the length of a given text.

(Actually, even this is a simplification from reality. The complete specification, which we do not implement in this assignment, can be found [here](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/counting-characters).)

Note that the remaining number of characters could very well be negative, if the Tweet text currently contains more than MaxTweetLength characters.

#### Running the application so far

Now that you have implemented the first function, you can start running the Web UI. To do so, you need to compile the UI to JavaScript from sbt (you cannot do this from your IDE).

In sbt, run:

```
> webUI/fastOptJS
```

If your code compiles, this will produce the JavaScript necessary to run the HTML page in the browser. You can now open the file web-ui/index.html in your favorite browser, and enter text in the first text area.

If you implemented tweetRemainingCharsCount correctly, the remaining number of characters should automatically update.

#### From remaining char count to "warning" color

For better visual feedback, we also want to display the remaining character count in colors indicating how "safe" we are:

- If there are 15 or more characters left, the color "green"
- If there are between 0 and 14 characters left, included, the color "orange"
- Otherwise (if the remaining count is negative), the color "red"

(these are HTML colors).

Implement the function colorForRemainingCharsCount, which uses the signal of remaining char count to compute the signal of color.

You can now re-run webUI/fastOptJS and refresh your browser. You should see the number of remaining characters changing color accordingly.

### Root solver for 2nd degree polynomial

The second part of the assignment is similar, for a different application: find the real root(s) of a 2nd degree polynomial of the form ax² + bx + c, where a is a non-zero value.

We explicitly ask for the intermediary _discriminant_, which we call Δ:

```
Δ = b² - 4ac
```

which you should compute in the function computeDelta, from the signals for the coefficients a, b and c. Note that in this case, your output signal depends on several input signals.

Then, use Δ to compute the set of roots of the polynomial in computeSolutions. Recall that there can be 0 (when Δ is negative), 1 or 2 roots to such a polynomial, and that can be computed with the formula:

```
(-b ± √Δ) / 2a
```

After compiling with webUI/fastOptJS and refreshing your brower, you can play with the root solver.

### Spreadsheet-like calculator

Now that you are warmed up manipulating Signals, it is time to proceed with the original goal of this assignment: the spreadsheet-like calculator.

To simplify things a bit, we use a _list_ of named variables, rather than a 2-dimensional table of cells. In the Web UI, there is a fixed list of 10 variables, but your code should be able to handle an arbitrary number of variables.

The main function is the following:

```
def computeValues(namedExpressions: Map[String, Signal[Expr]]): Map[String, Signal[Double]]
```

This function takes as input a map from variable name to expressions of their values. Since the expression is derived from the text entered by the user, it is a Signal. The Expr abstract data type is defined as follows:

```
sealed abstract class Expr

final case class Literal(v: Double) extends Expr

final case class Ref(name: String) extends Expr

final case class Plus(a: Expr, b: Expr) extends Expr

final case class Minus(a: Expr, b: Expr) extends Expr

final case class Times(a: Expr, b: Expr) extends Expr

final case class Divide(a: Expr, b: Expr) extends Expr
```

The Ref(name) case class represents a reference to another variable in the map namedExpressions. The other kinds of expressions have the obvious meaning.

The function should return another map from the same set of variable names to their actual values, computed from their expressions.

Implement the function computeValues, and its helper eval, while keeping the following things in mind:

- Refs to other variables could cause cyclic dependencies (e.g., a = b + 1 and b = 2 * a. Such cyclic dependencies are considered as errors (failing to detect this will cause infinite loops).
- Referencing a variable that is not in the map is an error.

Such errors should be handled by returning Double.NaN, the Not-a-Number value.

It is not asked that, when given an expression for a = b + 1, you compute the resulting value signal for a in terms of the value signal for b. It is OK to compute it from the _expression_ signal for b.

Once all of this is done, you can, once again, compile to JavaScript with webUI/fastOptJS and refresh your browser. You can now play with the simplified spreadsheet. Observe that, when you type in some expression, the values recomputed as a result are highlighted for 1.5s. If all ten values are highlighted every time you modify something, then something is wrong with the way you construct your signals.

Notice that, as you modify dependencies between variables in the expressions, the dependencies between signals adapt dynamically.
